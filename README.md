# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
# Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
This project was working with Sellby, an online e-commerce company.  We were to analyze their reviews written by customers who paid to write a review.  This program was called Amazin Vine, a service that allows companies to seed products to customers for free and in return they would write a review. 

For this project, we decided to review camera reviews, using PySpark to perform an ETL process.  Then we used Jupyter notebook to analyze the dataset. 

# Results: Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions:

* How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?
