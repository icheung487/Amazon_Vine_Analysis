# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
# Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
This project was working with Sellby, an online e-commerce company.  We were to analyze their reviews written by customers who paid to write a review.  This program was called Amazin Vine, a service that allows companies to seed products to customers for free and in return they would write a review. 

For this project, we decided to review camera reviews, using PySpark to perform an ETL process.  Then we used Jupyter notebook to analyze the dataset. 

# Results: Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions:

* How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?
* How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
* What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
# Summary: In your summary, state if there is any positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program. Use the results of your analysis to support your statement. Then, provide one additional analysis that you could do with the dataset to support your statement.
